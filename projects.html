        This is a repository of some of my projects. There is an interesting story, some unresolved arguments and a lot of time behind each of them. 
        I would like to think that they are, simultaneously, an indicator, and a non-factor, to what I would do in the future.

            largest democracy</h2></a>
            <p> The rise of political cyber troops in India has allowed disinformation to harness the power
                of the internet to influence citizens. This virtual escalation must be stopped to avoid
                creating a culture of mistrust and dishonesty. This essay presents arguments supporting why such a culture must be stopped. It was written along with Ignasi Cortes Arbues.</p>

It uses multi-objective optimization, game theory and welfare economics to propose a method to identify just water distribution policies between states that share a water body. The case study was the Susquehanna River basin in the United States.</p>
