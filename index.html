        I’m Sahiti. Of the many pronunciations and permutations of my name, my favorite is Sahityam/<a class="telugu">సాహిత్యం</a>. 
        I only recently got into the world of public policy where I try to channel my mild frustrations from accepting cookies, walking ill-lit streets, and noticing patriarchal institutions.

        I usually spend my time writing, coding, and playing storytelling games. But I’m most proud of holding 8-hour long conversations, moving apartments on a bicycle, wearing a saree in 5 different styles and my friends*.

        **I usually write essays with Leonardo and tell stories with Connor. They're both great to work with as well.
